Theory
Problem Statement: The task is to determine the largest element in an array of integers. This involves iterating through the array and comparing each element to find the maximum.

Approach:

Use a variable maxi initialized to the smallest possible integer value (INT_MIN) to store the maximum value encountered so far.
Traverse the array, and for each element, update maxi if the current element is greater than maxi.
Complexity:

Time Complexity: 
𝑂(𝑛)
O(n), where 
𝑛
n is the number of elements in the array. Each element is visited once.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂(1)
O(1), as no extra space is used apart from the variables.
Edge Cases:

Single-element array.
Array with all negative numbers

Algorithm Explanation
Input Reading:

Read the size of the array 𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠
elements).
Create a vector arr of size 𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠
elements to hold the array elements.
Input each element of the array using a loop.
Initialization:

Initialize a variable maxi to INT_MIN to ensure that any element in the array can potentially replace it as the maximum.
Array Traversal:

Loop through the array:
Compare the current element (arr[i]) with maxi.
Update maxi to the larger of the two values.
Output:

Print the value of maxi, which holds the largest element in the array.
